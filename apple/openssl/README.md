# README for iOS openssl

## Build Instructions

Used project https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/OpenSSL

That project creates openssl libraries for iOS device / simulator.
The libraries are separate for device / simulator but we will join them into a single `universal` library below :)

The project built as-is on a Mac with XCode and CLT installed.  The build takes a long time but does work.
